Masih tahap percobaan dlu yah

* Take some time between tasks for stillness.
* Sit out in nature, in silence, without technology.
* When you notice yourself reaching for your phone, pause. See if you can just be still, just savor some space.
* When you feel uncertainty or instability in your life (hint: it’s always there), let yourself feel it. Be present with it, without needing to run or avoid.
* When you feel fear, be open-hearted with it and allow yourself fully feel it, being friendly with it. Your relationship with fear will change if you become friendly with it.
* Do less, and trust that things won’t fall apart. Or if they do fall apart, you can be present with that instability.
* When you’re in line, driving, eating, walking, exercising … see if you can do those things in silence, without technology, without needing to do something “useful.” Find the value in these spaces.
* Notice who you are without the fear of space.

Savor these spaces, their deliciousness. Savor the groundlessness, as something filled with freedom if we learn not to fear it. Be present with the fear and uncertainty, as good friends not as enemies.

Let your heart be open raw tender and vulnerable, and your mind embracing the spaciousness of the vast blue sky of open awareness.
